## Welcome to my blog

I welcome each of you for visiting my blog, I will start uploading interesting information about programming and hundreds of things these weeks.

I hope we have fun together learning a little more and getting to know how computer science works.

I will comment a little about myself.

My name is Danilo, I am a graduate of the computer engineering degree of the UAGRM of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, this in the country of Bolivia.

Currently waiting to start my master's degree in Software Engineering, in the city of Saint Petersburg, Russia.

I started in this incredible area of ​​computer science thanks to the fact that I started programming in college. All for a programming contest that two friends invited me.

In the contest the challenge was to program solutions in C ++ to IOI or ACM ICPC style problems. The truth, learning C ++ in your first years in programming becomes quite hard. But it was worth it, we reached the national final as the best representatives of my state.

Since then I started to learn about competitive programming and with a clear idea I started college. The general idea of ​​this Blog is that it can help people who are starting in the world of programming, and in this way give back a little of what they gave me.
